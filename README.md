 Week 1: September 10 – 16
​Initial Setup: Daily work focused on setting up the new TSX/JavaScript project environment, defining data models, and configuring navigation structures.
​Architectural Migration: Started migrating base utility functions and setting up state management (e.g., using React Context or Redux equivalent).

​ Week 2: September 17 – 23
​Chef Dashboard Shell: Built the HomeScreen structure and basic UI components.
​Core Data Integration: Connected the app to the backend (data source) for fetching menu items.
​Dashboard Logic: Daily tasks involved implementing logic for the Chef Dashboard: calculating "Total Dishes" and displaying the static price for each course (e.g., Starter: R85.00).

​ Week 3: September 24 – 30
​Calculations Implementation: Finalized the complex logic for calculating the "Average Price by Course" (Starter, Main, Dessert).
​Full Menu Display: Implemented the scrolling "Full Menu" view on the HomeScreen, displaying all item details (image, name, description, price, course).

​This phase focused on building the crucial admin functionality for adding, editing, and removing menu items.
​ Week 4: October 1 – 7
​Add and Remove Screen Setup: Designed and built the "Add & Remove Items" screen layout and input fields (Dish Name, Description, Price, Image URL).

​"Select Course" Logic: Implemented the dropdown selector for assigning the course (Starter, Main, Dessert) to a new item.
​ Week 5: October 8 – 14

​Item Creation (CRUD - Create): Daily work focused on writing and testing the function to successfully add a new item to the menu list upon pressing "ADD ITEM."

​Item Listing: Improved the display of items under the "Current Menu" section for clarity, including their current price and course.
​ Week 6: October 15 – 21
​Item Deletion (CRUD - Delete): Implemented the functionality behind the red 'X' button to reliably remove a dish from the menu data and refresh the list.
​Data Persistence Refinement: Ensured that all changes (Add/Remove) persist correctly across application sessions.

​Week 7: October 22 – 28
​Image Handling: Finalized integration of the Image URL field, ensuring images load correctly for new and existing dishes.
​Input Validation: Added daily tasks for basic validation checks on price and required fields before an item can be added.
​Phase 3: Guest View & Final Polish (October 29 - November 11)
​The final weeks focused on optimizing the user-facing guest menu and preparing the app for release.

​ Week 8: October 29 – November 4
​Menu Filter Screen: Built the new "Menu Filter" screen (Guest Menu).
​Filtering Logic: Implemented the logic for the filter buttons (ALL, STARTER, MAIN, DESSERT), ensuring only dishes of the selected course are displayed.

​ Week 9: November 5 – 11
​UX Refinements: Daily tasks involved visual clean-up, ensuring all components are consistent with the new theme, and checking mobile responsiveness.
​Final Testing: Conducted end-to-end testing of the entire rewritten application (Admin workflow, Guest workflow, and data persistence).
